# Debugging Local Packages with `pnpm link`

If you’re tired of copy-pasting your local library into your app or publishing endless pre-release versions just to test a small change, there’s a better way.

`pnpm link` lets you connect your local package to your app, so you can debug and test changes without extra hassle. 

## Meet the Cast

Picture this:

- **cool-package/**:  a opensource package your working to contibute to because you trying to fix a bug.
- **my-app/**: The app that uses that package.

```
cool-package/
├── src/
│   └── index.js
└── package.json

my-app/
├── src/
│   └── main.js
└── package.json
```

Your `my-app/package.json` might look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@cool/package": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

But you want to test changes in `@cool/package` without publishing it every time. Here’s how to use `pnpm link`.

## The Two-Step Process

1. **Link the package globally**:

   ```zsh
   cd @cool/package
   pnpm link --global
   ```

2. **Link it into your app**:

   ```zsh
   cd ../my-app
   pnpm link --global @cool/package
   ```

   Now, your app uses your local version.

## Debugging

- Edit code in `@cool/package`.
- Run or debug `my-app`.
- If you need to build your library, run your build command.

## Unlink When You’re Done

To go back to the registry version:

1. In `my-app`:
   ```zsh
   pnpm unlink --global @cool/package
   pnpm install --force
   ```
2. In `@cool/package`:
   ```zsh
   pnpm unlink --global
   ```

## Summary

`pnpm link` is a useful tool for local package development. Its makes stepping into the code with breakpoints and debugging a breeze. [PNPM docs on link](https://pnpm.io/cli/link) for more details.
