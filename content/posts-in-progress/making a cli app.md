So i have alot of scripts

i've been doing a lot of typescript recent years. And i love it. The instant hot road experience is so good, async and await and there always being a NPM package for everything always makes me feel productive.

So of cource several times over the years i've

So I tell a joke to develop her sometimes when I'm working in Python. I tell them that python is my 10th. Best language. Junior Des will laugh at that and think it's a joke. I'll laugh and wonder if maybe it's my 8th or knife now.

I say that because I've gotten to the point of the career where language doesn't matter as much rather than the problem I'm trying to solve.

And I've learned quite painfully to quit trying to shove a square peg in a round hole. Instead, grab the language whose tools per packages almost have what I need.

Most recently out rode a CLI program for rest of my team to use.  I have a lot of custom scripts that I've written and just keep my machine and I occasionally will send one time gist link to different developers or admins.  

Constantly when I'm pairing or When I'm pairing or screen sharing for a meeting I'll do something or demo something. The others will ask me what that was.  I'll share them without not set it up so I got to the course. The most rational conclusion is I need to be able to create a CLI repo for the team.

So I reach for the tool I'm using the most often right now which is TypeScript. And there's some really nice see a lot of tools. Inquire zx a few others.

Since I'm also doing a lot of Python lately, I I've also created a lot of tools in python lately depending on which teams I was working with and what they're more comfortable with.  

However, I'm way more familiar and involved in the type script node community that I am Python.

So I have to knocking out a node CLI app for a few hours in TypeScript. And thinking and thinking like clapping my hands going. Well that's done.

That was into a day later when I ran into a really nice airflow breeze CLI.

This thing was so much better than mine. I'm not even going to compare the two.  But like most developers I go ooh new shiny cuz we forget about the repo we already started.

But I wanted to think about why. Why do I tend to build my CLR stuff in TypeScript instead of Python. Because honestly Python has a lot going for as a command line tool. Using a python tool is easy on Mac and Linux. And using WSL gives a really good terminal experience on Windows as well.  

There are amazing packages and tools very well. More developed on Python. I just didn't know about cuz I'm not familiar with that community.

Sometimes you take for granted the years of experience you may have in the community where you've seen trends. Come and go frameworks pop up and leave and abandoned. I have the institutional knowledge of the node community which I take for granted.

So here's to rewriting a CLI tool.
