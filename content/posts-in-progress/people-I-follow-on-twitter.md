Sling most people off follow others in my career on Twitter. And I have a simple test. Are they smarter than me? Which sounds like a weird test but hear me out.  Thanks to the amazing internet And the age of GitHub. I can literally go see the code of the people that I follow.  I can go get a sense for what type of developer they are.


Do they refactor a lot? Do they use test? Do they have the same sensibilities about best practices that I tend to. Would I like to work with them....


Do you open up a code that they've contributed and just amazed at how elegant it is? How simple it might if you're first glance but just how well it's off the problem where I know that I head offered or try to solve the same problem. My my solution would be 10 times as much code and twice as likely to break.

Those are the people I try to follow. To learn from. To imitate.

So let me say thank you to the few developers that I follow and hats off to all the things they've taught me over the years. By reading their tweets and reading code they've contributed.
