One of the first pieces if advise I give every everyone one I work with is to create a personal repo. Usually a private one.

some thing named like:

- `toolbox` (what I use)
- `scratch`

Its job is to keep the thousands of scratch pads, scripts, notes and one off sql commands in.


## Why?

Because during a meeting, take a note down, got a todo. throw it in markdown and get it off your brain. You can expand it into a better document but you have to get something stored in one form or another.

Don't worry about it being pretty or anything. Just put it there.

You can lean it up later. 


## My process

i have a command called `today`.








This isn't a repo keep a personal tool box repo.

public or private.
