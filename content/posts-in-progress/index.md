## Overview

Hello, I am a senior full stack developer and systems architect offering over 19 years experience and constantly working with new technologies. My recent focus is on web development using typescript and the supporting backends using Vue 3, Vite, Vitest and NestJS.  I also design and build solutions that leverage cloud functionality and scale to manage complex ad hoc data processing.

My focus is software development, but I started out in the operations side of things while attending college for computer science and that left the mind set that someone will have to support and maintain any systems I build. That means that I champion good testing, documentation and CICD processes.

With my experience I tend to work in any area I need, or interests me both in personal and work settings. For example in the last year I also built ETLs in python, Windows services in c#, mobile app in flutter. My greatest trait is my ability to learn, which gives me a wide range of technologies to move fast.
