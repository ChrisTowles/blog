# The Easiest Performance Win

<div class="text-2xl mt-10">

With new models dropping every month, the biggest improvement you can make isn't:

</div>

<v-clicks>

- ❌ Rewriting your prompts
- ❌ Fine-tuning a custom model
- ❌ Adding more RAG context
- ❌ Implementing complex workflows

✅ **Just upgrade the model**

A couple minute code change. No budget approval. Instant 50%+ gains.

Critical message: Don't overcomplicate this. The biggest gains aren't from fancy prompt engineering or custom models. It's literally just changing one string in your code. Emphasize the simplicity - this is the lowest-effort, highest-impact change they can make.

**What it measures:**
- Real GitHub issues and pull requests
- Tests ability to understand, plan, and fix actual software bugs
- Industry-standard for measuring coding capability

<v-clicks>

**Performance:**
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: ~49%

# Why Coding is the Best Benchmark

Address the skeptic: Why trust these benchmarks? Because code either works or it doesn't. Tests pass or fail. No wiggle room, no subjective grading. Wait for each click - contrast objective coding tasks with fuzzy tasks like "write marketing copy." Code benchmarks can't be gamed or optimized for.

# Better Every Call = Compounding Wins

The math gets interesting fast when you consider multiple attempts vs "single shot"

<!--
Transition to advanced concept: Most people think linearly about improvements. But AI gets retried - debugging, iterations, agent loops. Better per-call means MUCH better over multiple attempts. Set up the math coming next.
-->

# The Compounding Effect

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## Single Attempt

**Claude 3.5:**
- Chance of success: 49%
- Chance of failure: 51%

**Claude 4.5:**
- Chance of success: 77%
- Chance of failure: 23%

</div>
<div v-click>

## With 3 Attempts

**Claude 3.5:**
- Chance you solve it: **87.5%**
- (At least 1 of 3 succeeds)

**Claude 4.5:**
- Chance you solve it: **98.8%**
- (At least 1 of 3 succeeds)

11.3% absolute improvement
</div>

</div>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 text-center text-xl">

**Real Impact:** Bug you'd retry 3 times goes from 87% → 99% fix rate

</div>

</v-click>

<!--
The killer insight: With retries, 49% → 77% single-shot becomes 87% → 99% success rate. Walk through the math slowly. Show left side first (single attempt), then click to reveal right side (3 attempts). That 11% absolute improvement is MASSIVE - it's the difference between "usually works" and "almost always works." This is why better models compound in real workflows.
Math: 1 - (failure_rate^attempts). 3.5: 1-(0.51³)=87.5%. 4.5: 1-(0.23³)=98.8%

# OSWorld: Computer Use
## Autonomous Agent Capabilities

**What it measures:**

- Tests autonomous agent capabilities
- Measures ability to use computers like humans do

# Questions & Answers

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-5 text-sm">
<div>

**"What's the catch?"**

We hit throttle limits on AWS shared accounts. Default: 200 req/min. Raised to 1000/min. Non-prod done 10/24, prod pending.

**"How long until 4.5 is outdated?"**

Performance improves, price stays same. Quick adopters win now, upgrade free later.

</div>
<div>

**"Do we need to retrain our team?"**

No. Drop-in replacement. Change one parameter.

**"What about hallucinations/accuracy?"**

25% accuracy improvement (HackerOne). 89% → 98% safety score. Better at being correct.

</div>
</div>

<!--
Q&A preparation: These are the four most common objections/questions. Have answers ready. "Catch" = throttle limits (addressable). "Outdated" = upgrades keep coming (good thing). "Retrain" = no (removes barrier). "Hallucinations" = better accuracy (data-backed). Anticipate and address concerns proactively.
