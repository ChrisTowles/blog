<!--
Slide Suggestion:
- Visual: Side-by-side price tags showing "$3/$15" for both models
- Subtext: "Same cost. 58% better performance."
-->

# This is happening in AI, right now

Every few months, new models come out that are significantly better than the last generation.

But unlike hardware, where you have to budget, approve, and wait for refresh cycles, with AI models you can upgrade **instantly at no extra cost**.

# Autonomous Work Duration

<v-click>

A few caveats: These models can do long-running tasks autonomously, but how long can they actually stay focused?

</v-click>

<v-click>

The AI agent needs a way to measure if it's improving. That usually means tests, some feedback loop, etc.

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

**Performance:**
- **Claude 4.0 Opus**: 7 hours of focused work
- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet**: 30+ hours of focused work
- **Improvement**: <span class="text-green-400 text-2xl font-bold">4x longer</span> autonomous operation

**Translation:**
- Can handle overnight tasks
- Won't lose context mid-project
- Fewer interruptions for supervision

# Questions & Answers

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-5 text-sm">
<div>

**"What's the catch?"**

We hit throttle limits on AWS shared accounts. Default: 200 req/min. Raised to 1000/min. Non-prod done 10/24, prod pending.

**"How long until 4.5 is outdated?"**

Performance improves, price stays same. Quick adopters win now, upgrade free later.

</div>
<div>

**"Do we need to retrain our team?"**

No. Drop-in replacement. Change one parameter.

**"What about hallucinations/accuracy?"**

25% accuracy improvement (HackerOne). 89% â†’ 98% safety score. Better at being correct.
