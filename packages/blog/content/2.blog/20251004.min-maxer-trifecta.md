I have two hours free this weekend. Should I work on that MCP server project, or play [Last Epoch](https://lastepoch.com/) on Steam on Linux? The answer used to feel like a compromise - dev time versus downtime, productive versus "wasting time." Now it's both. I'm building a few Tools, and maybe an MCP server that helps optimize my Last Epoch builds, which means every gaming session is also research, and every dev session scratches the same optimization itch that drew me to ARPGs in the first place.

## Three Favorite Things, Never Enough Time

As a developer with 25 years in the industry, I've accumulated some consistent obsessions:

**AI Development** has become the puzzle that never gets old. Tuning prompts, designing tool workflows, optimizing context management - it's the same dopamine hit as solving a complex architectural problem, but faster iterations and immediate feedback.

**Software Engineering** remains the foundation. Building systems, designing APIs, managing state - this is still where I spend most of my professional time. The craft never stops evolving, and neither does the learning curve.

**ARPG Gaming** is my relaxation valve. Specifically Last Epoch - the skill tree complexity, build diversity, and satisfying loot loops. It's mindless enough to decompress, deep enough to stay engaging. I've even got my amazing wife Danielle to play it with me, but I do have to manage her loot filters!

The traditional conflict: gaming feels "unproductive." As someone who min-maxes everything (developer toolchains, learning paths, even my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ChrisTowles/dotfiles)), spending two hours grinding in an ARPG triggers the same guilt as fixing a CICD Build chain!. It's entertainment, sure, but is it the *optimal* use of that time?

The min-maxer's curse is that you can't just "casually" engage with anything. If I'm playing Last Epoch, I'm researching optimal passive tree paths from Bin Stash from Raxx https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EZclX7TpjI, comparing gear affixes, calculating damage breakpoints. If I'm going to play, I'm going to play *optimally*. My Wife doesn't get it, but she humors me.

My Chrome Bookmarks bar has a folder with subfolders to even optimize my gaming time:

it's even first to encourage me relax to play, but I end up researching builds instead of just playing.

## The Trifecta - When Dev Work Becomes Game Research

Enter the Last Epoch Build Assistant MCP server. 

**The concept**: Build a Model Context Protocol server that understands Last Epoch's build mechanics - passive trees, skill specializations, gear affixes, damage calculations. Not a static build guide, but a stateful assistant that learns your playstyle, suggests optimizations, and helps you theory-craft.

**Why MCP?** Because Last Epoch builds have exactly the kind of complex, stateful knowledge that MCP servers excel at managing. Your character's passive tree has dependencies (nodes require previous nodes). Your gear has conditional interactions ("+50% damage while you have a barrier"). Your skills have specialization trees that fundamentally change their behavior. This isn't "show me a build guide" - it's "given MY current build state, what's the optimal next choice?"

Sound familiar? It's the same pattern I wrote about in [my post on state-driven MCP servers](/blog/state-driven-mcp-servers). Game builds are just another state machine.

**The loop becomes virtuous**:

1. **Build MCP tools** for build analysis (validate passive tree, calculate effective DPS, suggest gear upgrades)
2. **Test with actual gameplay** - now it's not "playing games," it's "researching edge cases"
3. **Discover gaps** - oh, the MCP doesn't account for Frenzy stacks in DPS calculations
4. **Refine the server** - add support for buffs/debuffs, improve context management
5. **Return to gaming** - now with better build insights

What if I could build a validation tool that looks like using the AI SDK patterns:

```typescript
const validatePassiveTree = tool({
  description: 'Validate a Last Epoch passive tree and suggest optimizations',
  parameters: z.object({
    characterClass: z.enum(['Sentinel', 'Mage', 'Acolyte', 'Primalist', 'Rogue']),
    allocatedNodes: z.array(z.string()),
    targetBuildType: z.enum(['damage', 'defense', 'hybrid'])
  }),
  execute: async ({ characterClass, allocatedNodes, targetBuildType }) => {
    // Validate node dependencies
    const validation = validateNodeDependencies(characterClass, allocatedNodes)
    if (!validation.valid) {
      return {
        valid: false,
        error: validation.error,
        requiredNodes: validation.missing
      }
    }

    // Calculate stats and suggest improvements
    const stats = calculatePassiveTreeStats(characterClass, allocatedNodes)
    const suggestions = suggestOptimizations(stats, targetBuildType)

    return {
      valid: true,
      currentStats: stats,
      suggestions,
      unusedPoints: 120 - allocatedNodes.length
    }
  }
})
```

The satisfaction hits different from a typical side project. This isn't building a TODO app to learn a framework. This is building a tool that directly improves something I can test again, I really complex use case that *happens to be a fun at the same time*.

Like `SimulationCraft` for World of Warcraft or Decursive back in the day. Which means I understand every calculation, every assumption, every limitation. When I figure out how to coordinate with AI to learn that  "drop this passive node for that one". To learn  *exactly* why - because we theory crafted and wrote the logic. The last time I wrote a Game addon was for WoW in Lua when I wrote a PallyPower addon to track my Paladin buffs for my raid team in Molten Core. I still have that code somewhere.

## What Makes This Different From "Just Another Side Project"

Whats cool about this is this is not a toy problem. This is a real-world game used by thousands of people.

**The feedback loop is immediate**. Change the DPS calculation logic in the MCP server, boot up Last Epoch, test a build, see if the recommendations actually work. No waiting for user feedback, no A/B testing - I AM the user.

**Dual optimization scratches the same itch**. I'm optimizing the code (better algorithms, cleaner tool definitions, smarter context management) AND optimizing my character (better passive tree paths, more efficient gear, higher DPS). Both feel like solving the same type of puzzle.

**Gaming becomes guilt-free**. Every Last Epoch session now generates real insights for the MCP. That weird interaction between "Summon Wolf" and "Aspect of the Boar"? That's not me wasting time - that's discovering a use case the MCP needs to handle. I'm literally researching while I relax.


## The Broader Pattern

What if more developers found ways to combine their work and play like this?

**For Developers**: Stop building "interesting technical challenges" and start building tools that solve your real problems. The motivation stays high, the use cases are concrete, and the feedback is instant and testable.

**For Gamers**: Your optimization obsession isn't a distraction - it's fuel for learning. The same analytical mindset that drives build theory-crafting drives system architecture. [And that's pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3wrV0dRkRmg).

**For AI Enthusiasts**: Toy examples teach syntax. Real use cases teach judgment. Building an AI processing server for something you care about forces you to grapple with the hard problems - context limits, ambiguous user intent, state consistency.

**The meta-lesson**: The best side projects don't feel like work OR play. They feel like both, simultaneously. You're productive and relaxed at the same time. You're learning and enjoying. You're solving problems and having fun.

## The Best Part

When I boot up Last Epoch now, I'm not choosing between development and gaming. I'm doing both.

The insights I gain get better with every edge case I discover. My builds get better with every suggestion the MCP provides. And I actually *relax* while playing - because it's all progress. The min-maxer in me is satisfied because I'm optimizing two systems simultaneously. The developer in me is satisfied because I'm building real tools. The gamer in me is satisfied because I'm enjoying my favorite ARPG without guilt.

Three favorite things, one satisfying loop. That's the trifecta. On top of that it stops me from working on work projects risking my wife's ire for "always working." God I love her and my kids. And that's a win-win-win.
