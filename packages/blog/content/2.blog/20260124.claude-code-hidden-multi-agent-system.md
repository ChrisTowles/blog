Browser-based agent swarms are everywhere right now. Operator, Browser Use, the whole ecosystem is converging on multi-agent architectures for complex tasks. So when I saw a tweet claiming Claude Code already has a hidden multi-agent system baked in, my first thought wasn't "no way" - it was "already?"

Turns out: yes. Already.
