Browser-based agent swarms are everywhere right now. Operator, Browser Use, the whole ecosystem is converging on multi-agent architectures for complex tasks. So when I saw a tweet claiming Claude Code already has a hidden multi-agent system baked in, my first thought wasn't "no way" - it was "already?"

Turns out: yes. Already.

## The Claim

[Kieran Klaassen](https://x.com/kieranklaassen) posted on January 23rd:

> I think I found a hidden Claude Code feature! TLDR: It's a built‑in multi‑agent team system in Claude Code. TeammateTool lets you create teams, let agents join, message each other, approve plans, and shut down the team — but it's feature‑flagged and not enabled for most users yet.

He included a [gist documenting what he found](https://gist.github.com/kieranklaassen/d2b35569be2c7f1412c64861a219d51f) by running `strings` on the Claude Code binary. Bold claim. Let's verify it.
