Browser-based agent swarms are everywhere right now. Operator, Browser Use, the whole ecosystem is converging on multi-agent architectures for complex tasks. So when I saw a tweet claiming Claude Code already has a hidden multi-agent system baked in, my first thought wasn't "no way" - it was "already?"

Turns out: yes. Already.

## The Claim

[Kieran Klaassen](https://x.com/kieranklaassen) posted on January 23rd:

> I think I found a hidden Claude Code feature! TLDR: It's a built‑in multi‑agent team system in Claude Code. TeammateTool lets you create teams, let agents join, message each other, approve plans, and shut down the team — but it's feature‑flagged and not enabled for most users yet.

He included a [gist documenting what he found](https://gist.github.com/kieranklaassen/d2b35569be2c7f1412c64861a219d51f) by running `strings` on the Claude Code binary. Bold claim. Let's verify it.

## The Verification

I couldn't just `curl` the tweet - X.com requires JavaScript. So I set up the [Chrome DevTools MCP](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) to let Claude fetch the page directly:

```bash
claude mcp add chrome-devtools --scope user -- npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest
```

With browser automation in place, I navigated to the tweet, confirmed the claim, and then went hunting in the binary myself.

Claude Code stores its binaries in `~/.local/share/claude/versions/`. I'm running v2.1.19:

```bash
$ strings ~/.local/share/claude/versions/2.1.19 | grep -E "CLAUDE_CODE_(TEAM|AGENT)" | sort -u
CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_ID
CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_NAME
CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_SWARMS
CLAUDE_CODE_AGENT_TYPE
CLAUDE_CODE_TEAMMATE_COMMAND
CLAUDE_CODE_TEAM_NAME
CLAUDE_CODE_PLAN_MODE_REQUIRED
CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
```

That's not accidental naming. Let's dig deeper.
