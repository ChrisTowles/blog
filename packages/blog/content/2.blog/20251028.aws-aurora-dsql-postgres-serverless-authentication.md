## The Setup

I'm building AI chat features for my blog. I wanted Postgres because it's my go-to database. I decided to try the AWS stack since we use it at work.

I always use RDS at work but figured I'd try something new. Aurora DSQL caught my attention—serverless Postgres with distributed SQL. The pricing looked good for low-traffic personal projects. Way better than Aurora Serverless v2, which is AWS's special type of "Serverless"—it isn't serverless and doesn't spin down to zero.

I did my homework. Read through [the unsupported features list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/working-with-postgresql-compatibility-unsupported-features.html). Foreign keys? Don't need them. PostGIS and PGVector? Not for this project. 3,000 row transaction limit? My chat features won't hit that.

Nothing on that list was a dealbreaker.

## The Deployment

Created a CloudFormation template. Had to update SAM CLI first, and [there were issues, of course](https://github.com/ChrisTowles/dotfiles/commit/21e77ccb9689ebfdac2c944a1aa9e721dbdfd993#diff-af587fcc369e832087d96f2de7b3c0daaff070b88b329ad6e3c83a983d17ba98). A few small issues later, deployment succeeded. Resource created, endpoint ready.

Time to grab the connection string and wire it into my Cloudflare Worker.

That's when I saw it.

## The Discovery

No username field. No password field. Just: "Use IAM authentication."

AWS Aurora DSQL doesn't support traditional username/password authentication. Period.

Just [IAM authentication with temporary tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aurora-dsql/latest/userguide/SECTION_authentication-token.html) that expire every 15 minutes.

Here's how it works:
1. Create an IAM role with database permissions
2. Generate a temporary token (15-minute expiration)
3. Use the token as password
4. When the connection drops after 15 minutes, generate a new token

## The Problem

This immediately killed it for my use case.

Cloudflare Workers are serverless edge functions. Short-lived, stateless, potentially spanning minutes between invocations. The entire model assumes connection pooling or connection-per-request patterns with credentials that don't expire mid-session.

The 15-minute token expiration means:
- Can't use standard connection pooling (pool outlives token)
- Can't cache tokens between worker invocations reliably
- Need AWS SDK running in every worker to generate tokens
- Additional cold start latency for token generation
- More complexity for credential management

Could I have made it work? Probably. Generate token on each invocation, accept the latency, handle token refresh logic.

But at that point—why?

## The Missing Context

The unsupported features list told me about foreign keys and triggers. It mentioned the 3,000 row transaction limit and one-hour connection timeout.

What it didn't mention up front: "This database requires IAM authentication. No username/password support."

That's not a missing Postgres feature. That's a fundamental authentication model that changes how you architect your application.

Gee, AWS, I wonder why everyone uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) or [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for serverless Postgres these days? It's like you got so close, then just blew it at the last second.
