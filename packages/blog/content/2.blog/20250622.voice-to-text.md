The scene features warm golden light illuminating the speaker contrasted with cool blue screen glow, creating a contemplative mood about the evolution from traditional typing to voice-driven development workflows."

## Installation

```bash
ext install ms-vscode.vscode-speech
```

Or install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech).

## Background

As part of using more AI tooling while writing and editing code, I am looking to use voice-to-text. I used to use it to write my papers in college using Dragon NaturallySpeaking, but it was a pain to set up and use.

While I don't like the idea of only "vibe coding," I do like voice as a faster medium to get my thoughts out and refine them afterwards.

I am looking to use this in conjunction with the AI tools I have been using to help me write and edit code.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

I'm on Linux while writing this, so the shortcuts may be different on Mac or Windows.

There are two input modes:

- **Copilot Command**: `Ctrl+i` opens the Copilot command palette, then press `Ctrl+i` again to start recording. Hitting `Ctrl+i` again stops the recording.

- **Dictation**: `Ctrl+Alt+V` opens the microphone for long-term dictation recording. Hit Escape to stop. This is where I'm not giving Copilot commands, but just recording what I say as text on the page.

This is a great way to get my thoughts out and then refine them afterwards. I can also use this to write blog posts, which is what I'm doing now. I can also use this to write code, but I find it easier to just use the Copilot command.
