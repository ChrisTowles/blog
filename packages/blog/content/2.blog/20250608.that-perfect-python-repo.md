While working on my [last post about creating my own CLI tool - Towles Tool](https://blog.towles.dev/2025/06/07/creating-my-own-cli-tool-towles-tool/) I came across [that perfect repo](https://github.com/ChrisTowles/towles-tool) that has inspired me to take my project to the next level.


I was searching for a Python CLI tool that could help me manage my projects more efficiently. I stumbled upon that perfect repo at [fastapi/typer](https://github.com/fastapi/typer)!

The deeper I dug into the python cli command line ecosystem the more I realized how its doing it self at perfectly. From the intuitive command structure to the seamless integration with other tools, everything about it screamed perfection.

What really sets that perfect repo apart is its attention to detail. The documentation is thorough and easy to follow, making it a breeze to get started. The code itself is clean and well-organized, with clear comments and thoughtful variable names.

from most complex to simple tasks. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, that perfect repo has something to offer everyone.

Read the code in the file https://github.com/fastapi/typer/blob/master/typer/cli.py from most complex to simple tasks. 


When you relize the typer project has 10x more contributors, 100x more stars and is 1,000x better in every way. Its a humbling experience but also a motivator to keep pushing forward and striving for excellence in my own work.. . 


Its like touching the mind of god and seeing the perfection that is what Nobal Prize worthy. Tis is me saying i've seen the source code of the universe in this cli tool source code. Its when you realize that everything you can follow from https://github.com/fastapi/typer/blob/master/typer/cli.py is perfect. That whom ever created this must be a genius and a master of their craft. Its like looking at the mona lisa and realizing every brush stroke is perfect and needed. Its like listening to beethoven and realizing every note is perfect and needed. Its like reading shakespeare and realizing every word is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the great wall of china and realizing every brick is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the pyramids and realizing every stone is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the grand canyon and realizing every rock is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the eiffel tower and realizing every rivet is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the colosseum and realizing every arch is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the taj mahal and realizing every marble is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the great barrier reef and realizing every coral is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the aurora borealis and realizing every particle is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the milky way and realizing every star is perfect and needed. Its like looking at the universe and realizing every galaxy is perfect and needed. Its like looking at god and realizing everything is perfect and needed.

I feel like a mere mortal in the presence of a deity when I look at that perfect repo.

Also that feeling you get when you combine "feeling that feeling like its happened before" and "that what the most likely thing to happy in the sitcom that your in":.



`tiangolo`  `Sebastián Ramírez`



Do things the same way as `tiangolo`. Example. if i want to print to the screen. I should do it the same way as `tiangolo` would. in that Repository every way of doing something, is the correct. And if its not i'm not supart enought to understand why..... it will always  be the better answer than anything i could ever come up what that its just better odds of improving this world for my family and my self!



The exception is not using `uv`, 


So thats where i'm trying to figure when you `git



There is the Crazy idea. FOr years i've been playing around with the idea that we all are running around in our own echo chambers. That we all of history is just a series of overlapping narratives, each one reinforcing the beliefs of those within it. And when we encounter something that challenges our worldview, we often react with defensiveness or hostility, rather than curiosity or openness. Its a natural human tendency, but one that can be detrimental to our growth and understanding. 


the challenge is how do you build on the shoulders of giants when fail to remember what they said. Humans are forgetful creatures, and we often fail to appreciate the contributions of those who came before us. Its easy to get caught up in our own ideas and perspectives, and to lose sight of the bigger picture. But if we want to truly innovate and create something new, we need to be willing to learn from the past and to build on the work of others.



books, cave drawings, the internet, are all ways that we have tried to preserve and share knowledge across generations. But even with all of these tools we've forgeting of how to build on the threads of knowledge that have been passed down to us. We often reinvent the wheel, or fail to see the connections between different ideas and disciplines. Its a humbling reminder that we are all part of a larger story, and that our individual contributions are just one small piece of the puzzle.


But I think `git` is the answer. Its the perfect way to build on the shoulders of giants. Its a way to preserve and share knowledge across generations, and to build on the work of others. Its a way to create something new, while still honoring the past. Its a way to connect with others who share our interests and passions, and to learn from their experiences and perspectives. Its a way to create a community of learners and creators, who are all working together to build a better future.


The goal is to do things
