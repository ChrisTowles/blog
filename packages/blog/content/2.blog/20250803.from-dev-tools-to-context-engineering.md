## The Moment Everything Changed

I was deep in a Claude Code session last week, working through a complex refactoring, when something clicked. I wasn't just telling the AI what to do—I was carefully curating what it knew. Every file I opened, every command I ran, every piece of context I provided was shaping not just the current response, but the entire flow of our collaboration.

I've been even referencing the current trend of trying to edudcate people that **prompt engineering is dead and Context engineering is the future.**

And if context engineering is the future of AI-assisted work. And i don't mean just development. Think much bigger.  Then traditional developer tools—including my own Towles Tools—need to evolve to help me do that better. to with the scale of AI model improvment. by improving process with how I press to use that Advatage. 


## What was the purpose of those tools?

I made the repo to share the journal system I've developed over the years. For example at GE i have my peronal "Toolbox". Its a peronsal repo i share with no one. I just GE i have markdown file after markdown file. Why you may ask. It was becasue i found having the context of my work in a single place was incredibly valuable. I could look back at what I did, why I did it, and how it all fit together. I saw the value in having a centralized source of truth for my work. A second brain where i wrote down the rough ideas, the decisions I made, and the lessons I learned.

These where pretty or well formated but the content was raw and unstructured. I realized I needed a better way to organize and access this information.

## My Toolbox History

- I started with simple scripts and snippets, in a folder backed up on a Personal Drive
- I have built the hell out of it a few times. Sharepoint server, wordpress, ghost instance.
- then google wave, it was the best, so of course google killed it.
  - I have backup somewhere
  - Blogger
  - Medium
  - Notion
  - Roam Research
  - Obsidian
- when that died everything was backed up to a dropbox
- then i created new files in google drive
- TODO: the order of these are wrong.
- so many todo apps.
- google scribe

## how to generate text for the second brain

use the vscode text interface
- supports diction
- support spell checking
- LLM autocompletion
- use markdown file to communicate with claude instead of a separate UI
- send the text of your current ```slide``` to the AI for context
   - use the --- slide separator to parse the file and send info the the clude instance
   - TODO: test we can send the claude instance. and see it.
   - this closes the loop AI human feedback loop
   - human enters text, IDE autocomplete, linting tools, spelling and grammar checking applies, before sending for processing.
   - where the AI can access and update the context in real-time
   - leaves an artifact of the conversation in the file which can act as the plan file.to resume.
   - supports real-time collaboration and context sharing between team members

- have a lot of other ideas that I think will be valuable insights into AI enabled Future already much less if the continued processing and intelligence improvement.

So First i gota build the tool that will let me build in the next phase of Context engineering i see as already being here. Not just better prompts, but a whole new way of thinking about AI interaction.

## Because Context is King

Context engineering isn't just a fancy name for better prompts. As Andrej Karpathy puts it, it's "the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step."

Think about the difference:
- **Prompt engineering**: "How do I ask the AI to write better code?"
- **Context engineering**: "What does the AI need to know to understand my codebase, my goals, and my constraints?"

It's the shift from crafting clever instructions to building intelligent information systems. Context engineering treats the AI's knowledge as a dynamic, manageable resource—something you architect, not just something you feed.

### The MCP Revolution

In November 2024, Anthropic announced the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and everything changed. Suddenly, we had a standardized way to connect AI models to external data sources and tools. Within weeks, OpenAI and Google DeepMind adopted it. Within months, thousands of community-built MCP servers emerged.

MCP isn't just another protocol—it's the infrastructure layer that makes context engineering practical at scale.

## Why Traditional Dev Tools Are Hitting a Wall

I've been building developer tools for years, and there's a pattern I keep seeing: tools that were brilliant in isolation becoming productivity drains in an AI-first world.

The problem isn't the tools themselves—it's **context fragmentation**.

When I switch from my terminal to my IDE to my note-taking app to my project management tool, the AI loses the thread. Each tool maintains its own context bubble. My carefully curated understanding gets scattered across a dozen interfaces, none of which talk to each other.

The result? I spend more time re-establishing context than actually working.

### The Enterprise Reality Check

At GE Aerospace, where I work as Principal Architect on the Cloud AI services team, I see this playing out at enterprise scale. Teams are adopting AI-powered development tools, but they're hitting productivity walls because context doesn't flow between systems.

The tools that are winning—claude code aren't just adding AI features. They're fundamentally rethinking how context flows through development workflows.

## Towles Tools: Accidentally Perfect for Context Engineering

Looking back at Towles Tools, I realize we've been building context engineering infrastructure without knowing it:

- **Journal system**: Three types of structured documentation (daily notes, meetings, general notes) that capture work context over time

In fact, the journal system is already a context repository. It captures the essence of what context engineering is all about—storing and managing information that informs future decisions. For years' i've been searching my "toolbox" repo which was just markdown files locally. 

## Now with tools like @anthropic-ai/claude-code

## The Logical Evolution: Three Phases


### Phase 1: Context Submission

Add AI-powered, linter and grammar check improvement for text based context input.
why every bot recreates the worse chat interface right next to the words best editor right next to it.

**Make the tool, to make the tools**: This is growth hack, by building a better context edit process with VSCODE. the more quickly i can generate clear context, the more effectively I can build and improve the tools themselves.



### Phase 2 to N: Secret for now

I've got a lot of ideas on how to make the context repository more intelligent and useful. I'll keep those under wraps for now.

The goal isn't to replace existing workflows—it's to enhance them with intelligent context management that makes AI collaboration genuinely productive.

This evolution represents more than a feature update. It's positioning Towles Tools at the center of how developers will work with AI for the next decade.
