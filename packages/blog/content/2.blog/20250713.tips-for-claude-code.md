## some tips for using claude code

use every feature of claude code, not doing so is leaving power on the table.

- use dictation to give the model more context, every word helps narrow down the task to what you where expecting
- use the plan mode
- use `ctrl`+ `z` exit the claude code to terminal and then resume with `fg`
  - its so much better than the `!` bash command for running commands **WITHOUT** adding them to the context.
- use the `!` bash command to run commands that you want **added** to the context
  - running `--help` on a tool is a great way to get the model to understand the tool.
- use the memory
- use the web search
    - i've been linking to the readme of the repo i'm using at the time to load it into the context.
