## Use Every Feature
use every feature of claude code, not doing so is leaving power on the table.

- use dictation to give the model more context, every word helps narrow down the task to what you where expecting
- use the plan mode
- use `ctrl`+ `z` exit the claude code to terminal and then resume with `fg`
  - its so much better than the `!` bash command for running commands **WITHOUT** adding them to the context.
- use the `!` bash command to run commands that you want **added** to the context
  - running `--help` on a tool is a great way to get the model to understand the tool.
- use the memory
- use the web search
    - i've been linking to the readme of the repo i'm using at the time to load it into the context.
- using up arrow to repeat commands
- add commands to `.claude/commands` to make them available in the future and with $ARGUMENTS to pass arguments to the command


## Don't get distracted

- if you have an idea how to improve something, create an issue to remember it, but don't get distracted by it.
- write 


## Other Tips

- Think about how you manage context, the idea that the best communication = the best coder. [The New Code — Sean Grove, OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rABwKRsec4&t=1068s)
- so writing document specifications, is may be even more important than writing code.
  - give a look at this these reqiuirements for a project, which really imbrased that i used clade to translate from Japanese to English: [Requirements for a Project](https://github.com/ChrisTowles/cc-jsonl/blob/main/docs/requirements.md)
