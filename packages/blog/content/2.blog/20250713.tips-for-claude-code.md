## Use Every Feature

Use every feature of Claude Code—not doing so is leaving power on the table.

- Use dictation to give the model more context; every word helps narrow down the task to what you were expecting.
- Use the plan mode.
- Use `ctrl`+`z` to exit Claude Code to terminal, then resume with `fg`.
  - It's so much better than the `!` bash command for running commands **WITHOUT** adding them to the context.
- Use the `!` bash command to run commands that you want **added** to the context.
  - Running `--help` on a tool is a great way to get the model to understand the tool.
- Use the memory.
- Use the web search.
  - I've been linking to the README of the repo I'm using at the time to load it into the context.
- Use up arrow to repeat commands.
- Add commands to `.claude/commands` to make them available in the future and with `$ARGUMENTS` to pass arguments to the command.


## Don't Get Distracted

- If you have an idea how to improve something, create an issue to remember it, but don't get distracted by it in the moment.


## Other Tips

- Think about how you manage context. The idea may be already now that `the best communicator` → `the best coder`. [The New Code — Sean Grove, OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rABwKRsec4&t=1068s)
- So writing document specifications may be even more important than writing code.
  - Give a look at these requirements for a project, which really embraced this idea. I used Claude to translate from Japanese to English: [Requirements for a Project](https://github.com/ChrisTowles/cc-jsonl/blob/main/docs/requirements.md)
- Use pictures.
  - Claude Code can use pictures, so if you have a picture of the code you want to change, you can use that to give it more context.
  - Give Claude access to output of what running the code does so it can create a feedback loop to really improve.
    - Tests are great for this, but you can also use screenshots or text of the output.
    - For any web app, you can use Puppeteer to take screenshots of the output and use that as context.
