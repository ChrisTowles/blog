  # prompt: Create an image that visually represents the core message of adopting software engineering best practices and ITIL for a better work-life balance. The scene should feature a modern developer’s workspace: a tidy desk with a laptop open to a code editor (like VS Code), surrounded by elements symbolizing organization, automation, and calm—such as checklists, flowcharts, and a cup of coffee. The atmosphere should convey productivity, reduced stress, and harmony between technology and personal well-being. No text or logos.

As part to use move AI tooling while writing and editing code, I am looking to use voice to text, i use to use it to write my papers in college using Dragon NaturallySpeaking but it was a pain to set up and use. 


While I don't like the idea of only Vibe coding, i do like Voice as a  faster medium to get my thoughts out and refine them afterwards.

I am looking to use this in conjunction with the AI tools I have been using to help me write and edit code.


There Two input modes.

- Copilot Command
   cntl+i opens the Copilot command palette, then again to start recording. Hitting cntl+i again stops the recording.


- Dictation
    cntl+shift+I opens the dictation command palette, then again to start recording. Hitting cntl+shift+I again stops the recording.


Hitting central, alt and V opens up a long term dictation recording. So this is where I'm not giving copying commands, but just recording what I say the text on the page. 
This is a great way to get my thoughts out and then refine them afterwards. I can also use this to write blog posts, which is what I'm doing now.
I can also use this to write code, but I find it easier to just use the copilot command!!!!
