## Why I Never Used tmux

Never got into tmux. The keybindings felt arcane, config was intimidating, and I just... used multiple terminal windows.

## Discovering Zellij

What caught my attention, i've been trying to find a better claude code workflow. I keep switching between terminal windows, browser windows, and text editors. And while Claude has great session and  spin up agents on tasks. I wasn't managing my context very well. I'd open 5 terminal windows in vscode and then vscode would crash, i guess due to the claude code flickering . ANd then i'd have to reopen everything and get back to where I was. But the only way i could really rebuild it was by checking all the claude --resume threads i'd started. ANd trying to figure out which was done and which was still working.    Add the complexity of working on multiple repos at the same time, git worktrees, branches, etc. 



## Tips 

If you're new to terminal multiplexers, start with the default layout. Don't try to customize it.

Don't use any plugins or custom layouts yet. Just the default experience.


I started at first and claude helped me set up a layout... that was a huge mistake. I realized quickly that I didn't know what i did't know. So I scrapped it and started over with the default layout. 

This was what claude suggested configuration for me to start with:

do you kown what keybind does what, because i set the first hour trying to figure out what each keybind did.

The default gives all the keybindings on screen, and it's easy to split panes and navigate!

Reminder to self, super important to not try to run before you can walk.


>a common mistake i've made so many times with any new tool or tech is trying to run like i would with before i can walk. Picking up a new tool and immediately trying to make it like my old tool. Instead of learning the new tool on its own terms first. Chances are, the reason i'm using the new tool is because someone spent alot of time thinking about the problem and made different tradeoffs than the old tool. So trying to make it behave like the old tool is just fighting against the design of the new tool.



## Goals

- great multi-pane terminal experience that keeps me in the flow. Where new ideas can be spun up quickly, yet not distract me from what i'm working on as primary.
- agents in panes?
  - i thought about how i want to view and manage claude code agents. i think there is a chance you could tell claude code to use zellij to manage its agents. like open a new pane for each agent, and have them run in the background while you work in the main pane.
- easy to manage multiple projects/repos at once. 
  - worktrees?
  - multiple branches?

## Questions to Answer

- terminal or vscode terminal
  - worried that links to a location in a file will not directly open in vscode from zellij. need to test this.
  - if instead i use the vscode terminal, i already found the default keybindings conflict with vscode keybindings. don't really want to remap zellij keys if i can avoid it.
- How to best manage layouts
- Zellij has a plugin system. I wonder if anyone has made a claude code plugin for it yet?
