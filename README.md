# Blog Tech

- Paid for [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/) ($249) 
  - First, any time I spend doing CSS and even Tailwind is time wasted.
  - Happy to give back to NuxtLabs, I've used so much from [Anthfu](https://github.com/antfu), [Daniel Roe](https://github.com/danielroe) and Vue and Nuxt core members.
- Paid for Cloudflare ($5 Monthly)
  - can likely go back to free but ran over the 1mb file.
