Check `.current-plan` for task path, or ask user for topic/file.

Read `{task-path}/research.md` if it exists.

Interview me in detail using `AskUserQuestion` about:
- Technical implementation
- UI & UX
- Concerns and tradeoffs
- Edge cases

Ask non-obvious questions. Continue interviewing until complete.

Write the Plan to implement with TODOS and if large phases to `{task-path}/plan.md`.
