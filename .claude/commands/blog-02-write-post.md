# Blog Post Creation Command

Use the `blog-content-architect` agent to create high-quality technical blog content.

## Process

### 1. Explore & Research

- Search `packages/blog/content/2.blog/` for similar posts
- Use parallel subagents to WebSearch the topic
- Identify key sources, tools, and libraries

### 2. Plan & Question

Create a blog outline, then ask 3-5 focused questions (one at a time):
- User's experience with the topic
- Specific examples or use cases to include
- Preferred content structure (tutorial, guide, case study)

Prefer yes/no questions with smart defaults.

### 3. Confirm Plan

Show the outline to user and confirm direction before writing.

### 4. Write Post

Focus on:
- **Educational value**: Explain WHY, not just HOW
- **Technical accuracy**: Include working code examples
- **Authentic voice**: Share real experience and lessons learned
- **Practical insights**: Common pitfalls and troubleshooting
