# New Service Introduction (NSI) - MCP Server Project

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development and deployment of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation as a proof-of-concept service. The project will demonstrate the creation of a custom MCP server with authentication, AWS deployment, and VS Code integration.

### Project Goals
- Create a functional MCP server using Python
- Deploy the service to AWS infrastructure
- Integrate with VS Code for development workflows
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms
- Establish a foundation for future MCP server development

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely connect to data sources and tools. MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to access external resources while maintaining security and user control.

### Key MCP Concepts
- **Servers**: Provide tools and resources to AI clients
- **Clients**: AI applications that consume MCP services
- **Resources**: Data sources that servers can provide access to
- **Tools**: Functions that servers can execute on behalf of clients
- **Prompts**: Templates that servers can provide to clients

### MCP Architecture
```
Client (VS Code) ←→ MCP Server ←→ External Resources
                    (Python)        (APIs, Databases, Files)
```

# Authentication middleware
@app.middleware("http")
async def auth_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    # Token validation logic
    pass

# Login endpoint
@app.post("/auth/login")
async def login(credentials: LoginRequest):
    # Authentication logic
    pass
```
