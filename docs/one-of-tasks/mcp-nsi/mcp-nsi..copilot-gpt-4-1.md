# Service Introduction (NSI): Example MCP Server Project

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating an example Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, deployed on AWS, with a Python backend. The project will be completed over a 2-week timeline and will include key milestones such as initial setup, core MCP implementation, VS Code integration, and authentication.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to standardize the way tools and editors interact with AI models and services. MCP enables seamless integration between development environments (like VS Code) and backend AI services, allowing for features such as code completion, chat, and more.

## Project Milestones & Timeline

| Week | Milestone                                      | Description                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.1  | Project Setup & AWS Deployment                 | Initialize Python project, set up AWS environment (EC2/Lambda), CI/CD.      |
| 1.2  | Basic MCP Server Implementation                | Implement core MCP endpoints (e.g., chat, completion) using FastAPI.        |
| 1.3  | VS Code Usage Example                          | Provide sample VS Code extension or REST client to interact with MCP server.|
| 2.1  | Authentication Integration                     | Add authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to secure MCP endpoints.              |
| 2.2  | Documentation & Final Testing                  | Write usage docs, test deployment, and polish for handoff.                  |

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI or Flask recommended)
- **Deployment:** AWS (EC2, Lambda, or ECS)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline
- **Authentication:** JWT or OAuth2
- **Editor Integration:** VS Code (REST client or extension)

## Example VS Code Usage

Developers can interact with the MCP server directly from VS Code using either:
- A custom VS Code extension (sample provided)
- The built-in REST client (using `.http` files)

Example `.http` request:
```http
POST https://your-mcp-server.aws.com/v1/chat
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, MCP!"}
    ]
}
```

## Authentication

To secure the MCP server, authentication will be added using JWT or OAuth2. All endpoints will require a valid token. Example FastAPI integration:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer

app = FastAPI()
oauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl="token")

@app.get("/v1/chat")
async def chat(token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):
    # Validate token, then process request
    pass
```

## Deliverables

- AWS-deployed MCP server (Python)
- Example VS Code usage (extension or REST client)
- Authentication on all endpoints
- Documentation and setup instructions
