# Project Plan: Deploying Nuxt App to AWS ECS with GitHub Actions

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to deploy a Nuxt.js application to Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## 1. Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

### AWS Resources
1. Set up VPC with public and private subnets
2. Create ECS Cluster
3. Set up Application Load Balancer (ALB)
4. Configure Security Groups
5. Create ECR Repository for Docker images
6. Set up IAM roles and policies

### Base Configuration
1. Create Terraform configurations for infrastructure
2. Set up AWS CLI and configure credentials
3. Configure domain and SSL certificates (ACM)

## 2. Application Containerization (Week 1)

### Docker Setup
1. Create Dockerfile for Nuxt application:
   - Use multi-stage builds
   - Optimize for production
   - Configure environment variables
2. Create docker-compose for local testing
3. Implement health checks

### Image Management
1. Set up image tagging strategy
2. Configure image scanning
3. Implement cleanup policies for ECR

## 3. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline (Week 2)

### Workflow Setup
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow file:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to ECS
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   ```

### Pipeline Stages
1. Build and Test
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linting
   - Execute tests
   - Build application

2. Security Scanning
   - Run SAST scans
   - Scan dependencies
   - Container image scanning

3. Deployment
   - Build and push Docker image
   - Update ECS task definition
   - Deploy to ECS
   - Run smoke tests

## 4. ECS Configuration (Week 2)

### Service Setup
1. Create ECS Task Definition
2. Configure ECS Service
3. Set up auto-scaling policies
4. Configure logging and monitoring

### Networking
1. Configure service discovery
2. Set up ALB routing rules
3. Configure health checks

## 5. Monitoring and Logging (Week 3)

### Observability Setup
1. Configure CloudWatch logs
2. Set up CloudWatch metrics
3. Create monitoring dashboards
4. Configure alarms

### Performance Monitoring
1. Set up X-Ray tracing
2. Configure performance metrics
3. Implement custom metrics

## 6. Security and Compliance (Week 3)

### Security Measures
1. Implement WAF rules
2. Configure network ACLs
3. Set up security scanning
4. Implement secret management

### Compliance
1. Set up audit logging
2. Configure backup policies
3. Document security processes

## 7. Documentation and Training (Week 4)

### Documentation
1. Create deployment documentation
2. Write runbooks for common issues
3. Document monitoring procedures
4. Create incident response plans

### Training
1. Train team on deployment process
2. Review monitoring and alerting
3. Conduct incident response drills

## Timeline
- Week 1: Infrastructure and Containerization
- Week 2: CI/CD and ECS Setup
- Week 3: Monitoring and Security
- Week 4: Documentation and Training

## Success Criteria
1. Successful automated deployments
2. Zero downtime deployments
3. Monitoring and alerting in place
4. Documentation completed
5. Team trained on processes

## Risk Mitigation
1. Maintain rollback capabilities
2. Implement blue-green deployments
3. Regular security assessments
4. Backup and disaster recovery plans

## Budget Considerations
1. AWS infrastructure costs
2. CI/CD tooling costs
3. Monitoring tool costs
4. Training and documentation costs
