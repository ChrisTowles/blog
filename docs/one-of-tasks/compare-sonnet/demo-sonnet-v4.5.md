## Environment Variables Mapping

### From NuxtHub to AWS
```
NUXT_HUB_* → AWS Secrets Manager
NUXT_OAUTH_GITHUB_* → AWS Secrets Manager
Database: NuxtHub DB → RDS PostgreSQL connection string
Storage: NuxtHub Storage → S3 bucket
AI: NuxtHub AI → AWS Bedrock or external API
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Downtime during migration**
   - Mitigation: Blue-green deployment, DNS gradual cutover
   
2. **Data loss during database migration**
   - Mitigation: Multiple backups, dry-run migrations, verification scripts

3. **Cost overruns**
   - Mitigation: Set billing alerts, use AWS cost calculator, start with small instance sizes

4. **Performance degradation**
   - Mitigation: Load testing before production, monitoring dashboards, rollback plan

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **OAuth configuration issues**
   - Mitigation: Test authentication thoroughly in staging
   
2. **Static asset delivery delays**
   - Mitigation: Pre-warm CloudFront cache, optimize S3 configuration

3. **Container startup time**
   - Mitigation: Optimize Docker image, configure proper health checks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Application accessible via HTTPS on production domain
- [ ] All blog posts and content migrated successfully
- [ ] Authentication (GitHub OAuth) working
- [ ] Chat functionality operational
- [ ] Page load times < 2 seconds (p95)
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Automated deployments via GitHub Actions
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts operational
- [ ] Cost within budget ($X/month)
- [ ] Auto-scaling working as expected

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 7 weeks
- **Part-time effort**: ~15-20 hours/week
- **Full-time effort**: ~5-6 weeks

## Budget Estimate (Monthly)
- ECS Fargate (2 tasks): ~$50-80

- Application Load Balancer: ~$20-25
- S3 Storage: ~$5-10
- CloudFront: ~$10-20
- Data Transfer: ~$10-20
- CloudWatch: ~$5-10
- **Total**: ~$130-205/month (varies by traffic)

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up AWS account and IAM users
3. Choose IaC tool (Terraform recommended)
4. Create GitHub Actions workflow skeleton
5. Begin Phase 1: Infrastructure Planning
